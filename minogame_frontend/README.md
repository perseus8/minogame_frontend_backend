# Mino game frontend project
Built by React.js, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript

## How to install
Please use `yarn` package manager. For the migration, you can check `package.json` script commands.
You should set `.env` file before running the project.
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- `yarn build`

## Project description
I replaced `react-scripts` with `react-app-rewired`, and added `config-overrides.js` webpack configuration file. This is because `react-scripts v5` is not compatible with `@walletconnect`.

I used redux toolkit instead of traditional redux.

I used mui components.

## Wallet Integration
I used wagmi (https://wagmi.sh/) for the wallet integration. There are many other packages for the wallet integration such as web3, web3-modal, usedapp etc.

In my experiences, wagmi is one of the most useful packages in the aspect of customizing and using React Hooks. Wagmi supports various React hooks (https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useAccount) and they are very useful.

## Signature Algorithm
I used SIWE standard (https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).
Since we are using wallet for the authorizing, it is critical to use signature.
We request users to sign our messages when creating profile and updating profile for now.
